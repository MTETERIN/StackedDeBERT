'You guys are the best!'
'I'm meeting up with one of my best friends tonight! Can't wait! We'll have GIRL TALK!'
'Thanks for your response. I had already found this answer.'
'It was a crazy day of school. I was there for 10 hours straight. I am about to watch The Hills.'
'You should do the same.'
'The kitten is sleeping on my crotch which proves she likes me more.'
'Oh my God! We were both laughing off the hood! Because that's how we roll, right Shelly?'
'I'm having a long conversation with Mom on the phone.'
'Yay! I just requested her. What did she say?'
'Today is our two month anniversary! I love you so much, Diana. Oh my God, you don't even know!'
'Just trying to get inspired, that's all.'
'Oh, don't you love that I live for those days! Thank you for the picture!'
'My hand is still pretty weak. I can't punch anyone out yet or turn knobs, but it doesn't hurt too much.'
'You're telling me! I just finished doing 200 crunches! Let's Go!'
'Where is your home? Oh, I know Lexington, KY. It is right next to me.'
'I just spoke with my family in Japan via Skype. I love to see my little 16 month old nephew growing!'
'I'm not saying you should try it, but maybe you should.'
'I'm back from school, it was a long walk. It's so flipping cold outside. Two days ago it was sunny, the next day it was raining and today it's snowing!'
'Okay, I'll try to figure it out. I'm going to go to bed. Goodnight.'
'Oh, It's real, Jon! We all are so excited that you and the guys came back for us. We appreciate all that you put out there!'
'Thank you! I am at home pretty much anywhere, provided I have broadband. Just kidding.'
'I am calling it a night! I always have the best sleep after a good workout!'
'Hmmm, sure. So what are you up to? How was your day?'
'I agree. My kids got 'Who am I' for Christmas. It has been fun but I caught my 4 year old cheating by looking in the reflection of the TV.'
'What are you laughing about Ms. Yen?'
'Hell yeah, I'm definitely downloading it. Thanks.'
'We are so stinking cute.'
'I am pulling an all nighter with my best friend for life, Madison.'
'I'm going to bed. My baby isn't working and I am bored. Goodnight everyone. Tomorrow, love me harder than you did today.'
'I'm laughing so hard. Nigger please, you are acting like a fool right now.'
'Oh! I'm going to go buy Twilight on DVD today. I have to extend my overdraft for the second time in as many weeks, so I might as well!'
'I just got home from school. I meant to get my hair cut but I can't. I am dancing soon.'
'I'm going to sleep, I have an interview tomorrow! Wish me luck.'
'I'm not there yet. And I believe so. I hope there is a red carpet sighting.'
'I couldn't agree more! The unity and commitment was incredible. Considering the pressure they are under made it all the more amazing.'
'Hey, I want to get together.'
'I'm going to do both of those things.'
'Congratulations from Peru! You were and are amazing! I was speechless, thank you so much! Please come her someday, I'll seriously wait forever.'
'Sending much love to Mary and John, who are now both folling me on Twitter.'
'God sure does love me. I'm feeling really blessed tonight.'
'Not yet my brother from another mother.'
'Nice one! I'll take something. Yeah, there's a party over there. You know how much they drink. Will I be seeing you at Janet's party?'
'I am sorry, I am talking to my best friend so I haven't replied! But I can talk to you, too.'
'Oh, ok. Then I'm going to go and buy one for when I come visit.'
'Good morning, Chubbx! How are you today?'
'That is most excellent! There are a lot of people loving you.'
'I'm just watching three episodes of your show HM. I must say, I instantly became a fan of yours! I am loving your humor so much! More power to you!'
'Hey you!'
'I'm studying philosophy and math, also known as listening to music and being on Twitter, Facebook and Myspace.'
'Will you ask Donnie if he got the gift from my 9 year old last night?'
